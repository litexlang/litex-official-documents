Author: Jiachen Shen, Founder of Litex

Litex is a simple and elegant formal language that can be learned in just 2 hours. Our goal is to tackle one of the biggest challenges of the AI era: enhancing large language models with stronger reasoning and mathematical exploration capabilities at the language level.

Litex is now drawing significant attention from the community. It reached the top 10 on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45369629) on September 27, 2025. It was featured by the renowned AI news outlet [The Heart of Machines SOTA](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/WWaVIPhzpUZCxcOAR29LTg). Litex is rapidly becoming a very promising tool for AI-driven mathematical exploration.

Litex has now evolved from a one-person project into a community-driven initiative. This blog post marks the beginning of our community-driven journey. We warmly welcome you to [contact us](mailto:litexlang@outlook.com) to join our communityâ€”whether you want to share ideas, ask questions, or showcase a Litex-related project. Contributions are always welcome. Thank you!
