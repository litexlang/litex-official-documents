# enum works by enumerating all values in a finite set and verifying
# that the conclusion holds for all values satisfying the domain condition.
#
# General workflow:
# 1. Enumeration: Iterate through each value in the given list_set (e.g., {1, 2, 3, 4, 17})
# 2. Domain check: For each enumerated value, check if it satisfies the dom condition
#    - If satisfied: proceed to execute the prove section
#    - If not satisfied: skip this value (it's not in the domain)
# 3. Proof execution: For values satisfying dom, execute the proof steps in the prove section
# 4. Conclusion verification: After proof execution, verify that the => conclusion holds
# 5. Universal fact generation: If all values satisfying dom pass verification, generate
#    the corresponding forall fact: forall x in S, if dom(x) then conclusion(x)
#
# General form:
#   enum x S:
#       dom:
#           <domain condition on x>
#       =>:
#           <conclusion to prove>
#       prove:
#           <proof steps>
#
# This generates: forall x in S, if <domain condition> then <conclusion>
#
# Example: This proves that for all even numbers in {1, 2, 3, 4, 17},
#          they must be either 2 or 4.
enum x {1, 2, 3, 4, 17}:
    dom:
        x % 2 = 0
    =>:
        x = 2 or x = 4
    prove:
        do_nothing


have s finite_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 17}
enum x s:
    dom:
        x % 2 = 0
    =>:
        x = 2 or x = 4
    prove:
        do_nothing
