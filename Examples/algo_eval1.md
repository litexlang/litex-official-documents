```litex
fn f(x R) R
know:
    forall x R: x > 0 => f(x) = x + 1
    forall x R: x < 0 => f(x) = x - 1
    f(0) = 0

algo f(x):
    if x = 0:
        return 0
    if x > 0:
        return x + 1 # it's ok to write `x + 2` here, but when you eval f(1), it is impossible to verify f(1) = 1 + 2, and the evaluation fails.
    if x < 0:
        return x - 1

eval(f(1)) # Invoke condition if x > 1
f(1) = 2

eval(f(-1)) # Invoke condition if x > 0
f(-1) = -2

eval(f(0)) # Invoke x = 0
f(0) = 0

have a R = 2
eval(f(a)) # replace a with its value 2, eval f(2)
f(a) = 3

eval(f(f(a)))
f(f(a)) = 4
