# Special Thanks

Throughout this wonderful journey of designing, implementing, spreading Litex, I (Jiachen Shen, creator of Litex) received much help from my friends and colleagues. Without their support, Litex has no chance of succeeding. I have special thank to my coworker Zhaoxuan Hong, who developed official website and tool chains of Litex. The Litex project is also indebted to Siqi Sun, Wei Lin, Peng Sun, Jie Fu, Zeyu Zheng, Huajian Xin, Zijie Qiu, Sheng Xu. Moreover, I cannot fully express my gratitude to those who have contributed actively to the community. I am sure this special-thanks list will be longer in the future. Feel free to join us to build the future together!
