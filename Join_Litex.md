# Join Litex

_There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses_

_-- Bjarne Stroustrup_

Litex is a young language evolving at a very fast pace. We are looking for more interested people to join us to make Litex better. No matter you are a programmer, an educator, a math student, or AI researcher, you can surely find something to contribute to Litex. Before that, you can take a look at Litex's design, development, and dissemination philosophy to gain a deeper understanding of the Litex project.

1. You are interested in AI for math and in codifying mathematics, and believe this is the future.

2. You recognize that Litex will play an increasingly important role in codifying mathematics, AI for math, and AI for reasoning.

If you agree with the above two points, then it is even better if you also agree with the following development philosophies:

_A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week._

_- General George S.Patton_

_Cross the river by feeling to stones._

_- Chinese Proverb_

[worse is better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html): It is the development and design principle behind Unix, JavaScript and many other successful projects. The worse-is-better philosophy means that implementation simplicity has highest priority, which means Unix and C are easy to port on such machines. Therefore, one expects that if the 50% functionality Unix and C support is satisfactory, they will start to appear everywhere. So early publication, fast iteration, continuous receiving user feedback, integration to existing systems is the core of a truly pragmatic and influential software.

_Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently._

_- Henry Ford_

_To be uncertain is to be uncomfortable, but to be certain is to be ridiculous_

_- Chinese Proverb_

[move fast and break things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_fast_and_break_things): It is the early motto of Facebook. It means that we should move fast, receive feedbacks from users, and break the previous designs and implementations to make things better. This is critical for the survival of a young project like Litex.
