## Simple, Intuitive, Expressive — Learnable For Humans & AI 

_Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication._

_– Leonardo da Vinci_

[Congratulations! Litex achieves top 10 on Hacker News on 2025-09-27!!](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45369629)

**Warning: Litex is still in beta. The syntax and semantics are subject to change. There might be some bugs and inconsistencies. You should not use Litex in any production environments yet.**

Litex([website](https://litexlang.com)) is a simple open-source formal language, learnable in 2 hours by anyone. It expresses mathematics in the form of code, ensuring that every step of the reasoning process is rigorously correct. The closeness of Litex to natural language can be really helpful for AI and human alike in mathematical exploration and problem-solving. I hope you will forget that you are using a formal language to write mathematics using Litex!([Star the repo!](https://github.com/litexlang/golitex)). 

Making Litex intuitive to both humans and AI is Litex's core mission. Just like how Python lowers the barrier of programming by 10x compared with C/C++, Litex lowers the barrier of formal reasoning by 10x compared with previous formal languages like Lean. This is how Litex scales formal reasoning: by making it accessible to more people, and usable by large-scale AI systems. Here is an example:

While Lean 4 is a powerful and rigorous proof assistant ideal, it requires months of training and years of experience to master. Litex takes a different approach: prioritizing accessibility and ease of use, enabling even beginners to formalize naive tasks like multivariate equations in minutes. For many everyday reasoning tasks, Litex offers a more approachable path. 

For mathematical research, a well-designed formal language can clarify the dependency structure among complex theorems and lay the foundation for large-scale collaborative “Big Mathematics.” For AI, such a formal language enables reasoning models to form a self-reinforcing cycle of automatic problem generation → automatic solving → automatic verification. Combined with the reinforcement-learning-based post-training approach demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1, this may lead to a breakthrough moment comparable to AlphaGo.

Our mission is to make Litex the most intuitive and simple formal language for coding reasoning. We aim to solve the most challenging problems faced by the AI community, i.e. the challenge of efficient, scalable, and reliable coding reasoning. Let's build the future together!

Although Litex is a very pragmatic language which contains and only contains the proof methods, axioms, keywords, etc. that people need in their daily mathematical work—things that are often so taken for granted that people usually don't even notice them —- it is equally important to note that Litex indeed has gained great conceptual inspiration from the masters.
