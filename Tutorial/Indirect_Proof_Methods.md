# Indirect Proof Methods

In mathematics, there are various proof methods or proof strategies. While the most intuitive one is the direct proof, where we proceed step by step from assumptions to the desired conclusion, many other methods are equally important:

Proof by Contradiction – Assume the opposite of what you want to prove, and show that this leads to a contradiction.

Proof by Cases – Divide the situation into several possible cases, prove the statement in each case, and conclude that it holds universally.

Proof by Induction – Establish a base case, then show that if the statement holds for one step, it also holds for the next, covering all natural numbers.

Proof over a Finite Set – When the domain is finite, check each possibility exhaustively.

Without these methods, we cannot prove many important theorems. For example, we cannot prove the irrationality of sqrt(2) without proof by contradiction. Fundamentally, these methods are different from direct proofs.

## Direct vs. Indirect Proofs

Direct Proof (step-by-step reasoning):
You start from known facts and definitions, then apply logical deductions in sequence until you reach the conclusion. It is linear and constructive.

Other Proof Methods (indirect or structured approaches):
These methods may not proceed in a single straight line. Instead, they introduce intermediate structures (cases, assumptions, induction steps, exhaustive checks) to handle more complex situations.

We will explore these methods in detail in the following sections.
