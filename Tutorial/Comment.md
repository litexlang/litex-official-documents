# Comment

Litex support to add one-line Comment by symbol `# ` and multi-line Comment by symbol `"""`:

```litex
# claim an Object x in R and make x > 1
let x R:
    x > 1
```

```litex
"""
some comment
some comment
some comment
"""
```

Comments are very helpful for you to understand the code and for the system to check your code.
