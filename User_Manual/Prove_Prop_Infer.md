# Prove prop infer

## Descirption

When you use `prove_prop_infer`, you're telling Litex: "Whenever this proposition is true, automatically remember these consequences." This eliminates the need to repeatedly apply the same implication manually.

## Syntax
```
prove_prop_infer $proposision:
            =>: consequences_facts
            prove:
            prove_steps
```

## Examples
```litex
prop p(x R):
    x > 2

prove_prop_infer $p(x):
    =>:
        x > 0
    prove:
        x > 2
        x > 0
let x R: $p(x)

x > 0 # verified by x > 0, generated by prove_prop_infer $p(x) => x > 0

```
## Semantics
Execution of this statement has the following effects:

1. Registers $proposision as a valid inference rule in the environment.

2.The system executes the prove block steps. It checks if the final state of the proof matches the statement in the => block

3.Unlike `claim` which proves a specific fact, `prove_prop_infer` verifies the structural logic. Once proven, this rule can be used ("inferred") with any concrete propositions that match the pattern.
