# Define, Verify, Memorize, Infer

_Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works._

_- Steve Jobs_

Any mathematical statement has some of the following effects: Define, Verify, Memorize, Infer. Define is the process of defining a new object or a new proposition predicate. Verify is the process of verifying a statement. Memorize is the process of memorizing a new fact for future use. Infer is the process of inferring new facts from your newly memorized facts.

## Define

A statement in natural language involves nouns and verbs. In math, we have objects and proposition predicates. For example, `2 > 1` is a statement that involves the objects `2` and `1` and the proposition predicate `>`. Besides builtin objects and predicates like `1`, `2`, `3`, `>`, `=`, `!=`, you can also define your own objects and predicates using `have`/ `let` and `prop` keywords.

## Verify

The core functionality of Litex is to verify statements. When you write a statement in Litex, Litex will try to use memorized facts to verify the statement. If the statement is verified, Litex will memorize the fact for future use.

## Memorize

Memorization is the process of storing facts in Litex's knowledge base. When you write a statement in Litex, Litex will memorize the fact for future use.

## Infer

Infer is the process of inferring new facts from your newly memorized facts. When you write a statement in Litex, Litex will infer the fact for future use.
