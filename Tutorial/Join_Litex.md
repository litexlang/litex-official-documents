# Join Litex

_There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses_

_-- Bjarne Stroustrup_

Litex is a young language evolving at a very fast pace. We are looking for more interested people to join us to make Litex better. No matter you are a programmer, an educator, a math student, or AI researcher, you can surely find something to contribute to Litex. Before that, you can take a look at Litex's design, development, and dissemination philosophy to gain a deeper understanding of the Litex project.

1. You are interested in AI for math and in codifying mathematics, and believe this is the future.

2. You recognize that Litex will play an increasingly important role in codifying mathematics, AI for math, and AI for reasoning.

If you agree with the above two points, then you should consider the following development philosophy:

[worse is better](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html): It is the development and design principle behind Unix, JavaScript and many other successful projects. It basically says

"The worse-is-better philosophy means that implementation simplicity has highest priority, which means Unix and C are easy to port on such machines. Therefore, one expects that if the 50% functionality Unix and C support is satisfactory, they will start to appear everywhere. And they have, haven't they? Unix and C are the ultimate computer viruses."
