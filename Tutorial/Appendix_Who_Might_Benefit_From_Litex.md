# Appendix: Who Might Benefit From Litex

Litex is for everyone. Here are some people who might especially benefit from Litex.

1. AI researchers. Researchers from OpenAI, Google, Alibaba, DeepSeek, etc are exploring the loop of model itself writes a question, itself solves, and in this way, the model itself improves itself. This is a very promising direction. They need something to tell whether the reasoning process is correct. Litex can be used to ensure the correctness of the reasoning process as long as the reasoning process is formalized in Litex. This makes Litex a very fundamental infrastructure for AI. At the same time, AI safety researchers need to ensure the safety of the output of the model, and now they are turning to formal languages for help. As models are becoming more and more powerful and dangerous, the need for formal languages is becoming more and more urgent. 

2. Mathematicians. As we all know, a small piece of error in a proof can lead to a huge disaster, while somehow human beings still manage to push the frontier of math to a very high level. This is truly remarkable. That is why I am excited to see what we can do with Litex, a power tool ensuring the correctness of any piece of reasoning and saving mathematicians from the tedious work of proof checking. Mathematicians can finally work together with a stranger and the Litex kernel gives you the certificate of correctness of his/her contribution. The scale of collaboration, the scale of mathematical discovery, and the scale of mathematical knowledge are all going to be scaled up to a new level that nobody can imagine.

## Applications of Formal Reasoning in AI and Many Other Fields

The goal of Litex is to scale reasoning at this AI era by making it more accessible to everyone. Litex scales reasoning in three ways:

**Engineering:** Like software engineering, Litex turns individual math work into **mathematical engineering** through clear abstraction and composition. Writing math in Litex can be as simple as writing code in Python.

**Accessibility:** Being much simpler than other formal languages, Litex enables **more people** to participate in formal reasoning, from children to experts.

**AI Integration:** Litex provides the perfect **infrastructure for AI** to learn and perform formal reasoning at scale.


## AI

AI research is shifting from data-driven learning to formal-language-driven reinforcement learning in 2025. With dataset exhaustion becoming common, companies are adopting formal language approaches for self-improving AI systems, inspired by AlphaZero's self-play methodology.

1. [DeepSeek-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948): DeepSeek-R1 uses formal language as value function for Reinforcement Learning, making their model extremely efficient and accurate.

2. [AlphaProof](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/): AlphaProof uses formal language to formulate problems, solve them, and improve the model based on formal language interpreter output. It is a good example of how a model self iteratively improves itself. It achieves silver medal level in IMO, which is super-human level in math.

3. [AlphaGeometry](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/): AlphaGeometry is another example of how a model self iteratively improves itself. It achieves gold medal level in IMO geometry problems, which is super-human level in math.

4. [Safeguarded AI](https://www.aria.org.uk/opportunity-spaces/mathematics-for-safe-ai/safeguarded-ai/): The applications of formal reasoning in AI safety is drawing more and more attention, and this is one of the first AI safety organizations to pay attention to formal reasoning. Turing award recipient Yoshua Bengio joins Safeguarded AI as Scientific Director.

5. [Formal Mathematical Reasoning: A New Frontier in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16075): This article argues AI-driven discovery in science, engineering, and beyond can be accelerated by the adoption of formal reasoning.

## Math

As modern math is becoming more and more abstract and complicated, the math community is turning to new methods to manage the complexity. On one hand, they turn to AI to make new propositions and even generate new theorems. On the other hand, they turn to formal reasoning to verify the correctness of their proof and scale mathematical collaboration.

1. [Machine Assisted Proof](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/machine-assisted-proof-notices.pdf): In this article, Fields Medalist Terence Tao forecasts the great potential of the combination of formal reasoning and machine learning in math.

2. [Mathematics and the formal turn](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00007): In this article, Lean advisory board member Jeremy Avigad argues that the formal turn in mathematics holds a lot of promise and the new technology will undoubtedly alter our conception what it means to do mathematics
