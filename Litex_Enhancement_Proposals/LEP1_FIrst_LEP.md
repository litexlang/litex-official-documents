**About LEP (Litex Enhancement Proposals)**

LEP stands for Litex Enhancement Proposals. This series documents important updates, announcements, technical discussions, and community guidelines for the Litex project. LEPs serve as a formal way to communicate significant changes, design decisions, and community information to all Litex users and contributors.

Litex is a simple and elegant formal language that can be learned in just 2 hours. Our goal is to tackle one of the biggest challenges of the AI era: enhancing large language models with stronger reasoning and mathematical exploration capabilities at the language level.

Litex has now evolved from a one-person project into a community-driven initiative. This blog post marks the beginning of our community-driven journey. We warmly welcome you to [contact us](mailto:litexlang@outlook.com) to join our community—whether you want to share ideas, ask questions, or showcase a Litex-related project. Contributions are always welcome. Thank you!
