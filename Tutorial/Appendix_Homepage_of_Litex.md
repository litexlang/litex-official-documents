## Litex: The First Formal Language Learnable in 1–2 Hours

_Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication._

_– Leonardo da Vinci_

Litex([website](https://litexlang.com)) is a simple, intuitive, and open-source formal language for coding reasoning ([Star the repo!](https://github.com/litexlang/golitex)). It ensures every step of your reasoning is correct, and is actually the first reasoning formal language (or formal language for short) that can be learned by anyone in 1–2 hours, even without math or programming background.

Making Litex intuitive to both humans and AI is Litex's core mission. This is how Litex scales formal reasoning: by making it accessible to more people, applicable to more complex problems, and usable by large-scale AI systems. These benefits stem from Litex's potential to lower the entrance barrier by 10x and reduce the cost of constructing formalized proofs by 10x, making formal reasoning as natural as writing.

Here is a comparison between Litex and traditional formal language Lean.

Even Kids can formalize the multivariate equation in Litex in 2 minutes, while it require an experienced expert hours of work in Lean 4. It is a typical example of how Litex lowers the entrance barrier by 10x, lowers the cost of constructing formalized proofs by 10x, making formalization as easy and fast as natural writing. No foreign keywords, no twisted syntax, or complex semantics. Just plain reasoning.

## Resources And Community

_The best way to predict future is to create it._

_-- Alan Kay_

Litex is nothing without its community and technical ecosystem.

Hi, I’m Jiachen Shen, creator of Litex. It is so fortunate to receive tremendous help from friends and colleagues throughout this journey of designing, implementing, and growing Litex into a community. Without their support, Litex would not have had the chance to succeed.

I owe special thanks to my friend Zhaoxuan Hong, who built Litex’s powerful toolchains and has supported the project from the very beginning. I am also deeply grateful to Siqi Sun, Wei Lin, Peng Sun, Jie Fu, Zeyu Zheng, Huajian Xin, Zijie Qiu, Siqi Guo, Haoyang Shi, Chengyang Zhu, Chenxuan Huang for their invaluable contributions. I am certain this list of special thanks will only grow longer in the future.
