# Introduction

This document compares Litex and Lean in expressing basic math statements through side-by-side code examples. All the examples below represent common categories of mathematical expressions, such as defining functions, basic arithmetic operations, proving existence, etc. 

This comparison serves several purposes:
1. Expressing basic mathematical capabilities
2. Expressing capabilities for long mathematical reasoning
3. Differences in mathematical foundations
4. Differences in execution mechanisms
5. Differences in kernel implementations
6. Differences in AI applications
