# Prove by Induction: The Power of Recursion

## The Core Idea

Mathematical induction is like a line of dominoes:

* First, you show that the very first domino falls (**base case**).
* Then, you show that whenever one domino falls, it will push the next one down (**induction step**).
* Therefore, all the dominoes will eventually fall, meaning the statement is true for every case.

## Two Key Steps

1. **Base Case**
   Prove the statement for the first number (often $n = 0$ or $n = 1$).

2. **Induction Step**
   Assume the statement is true for some number $n = k$ (this is the **induction hypothesis**).
   Then prove it must also be true for $n = k+1$.

## Why It Works

Once both steps are done, youâ€™ve shown the statement works for the first case, and that the truth passes from each number to the next. 

It is so simple that people often overlook it; yet it is actually a mathematical axiom, without which the whole tower of mathematics would collapse.

Litex uses keyword `prove_by_induction` to support proving by induction.

```
prove_by_induction(specific_fact, the_object_you_want_to_iterate_over, induction_begin_from_positive_index)
```

For example, there is a proposition `p(x, n)` that is true for `n = 2` and when `p` is true for `n`, it is also true for `n+1` if `n >= 2`. We want to prove that `p(x, n)` is true for all `n >= 2`.

```litex
prop p(x R, n N_pos)

let x R

know:
    forall n N_pos: n >= 2, $p(x, n) => $p(x, n+1)
    $p(x, 2)

prove_by_induction($p(x, n), n, 2)

forall n N_pos: n >= 2 => $p(x,n)
```
