## What is Litex?

_Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication._

_– Leonardo da Vinci_

---

[Litex](https://litexlang.com) is a simple open-source computer language for mathematical proofs. It aims to express mathematics as code while staying as close to natural language as possible, making it both rigorous and accessible. ([Star the repo!](https://github.com/litexlang/golitex)) With just one to two hours of learning the fundamentals, you can write code that solves interesting mathematical problems with verified correctness! Litex automatically verifies your proofs and shows you step-by-step how each inference is executed, making the reasoning process transparent and educational.

How does Litex work? It achieves its simplicity by imitating how people reason and how mathematics works. *Litex uses a set of axioms (i.e. ZFC axioms and basic logic) and inference rules that are sufficiently expressive to capture mathematical concepts. (axioms + inference rules = math world)* Its close-to-natural-language syntax means users often forget they're using a formal language, lowering the barrier of formal reasoning by 10x compared with traditional formal languages. We want to make Litex easy-to-learn even for 10-year-old beginners in mathematical proof and verification.

[Official Documentation](https://litexlang.com) is our website. Read [Tutorial](https://litexlang.com/doc/Tutorial/Introduction), [How Litex Works](https://litexlang.com/doc/How_Litex_Works/Introduction) for more details. [Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/litexlang) is on Hugging Face.

## Why Litex?

_Our intent was to create a pleasant computing environment (Unix) for ourselves and our hope was that others liked it._

While Lean 4 is a powerful and rigorous proof assistant ideal, it requires months of training and years of experience to master. Litex takes a different approach: prioritizing accessibility and ease of use, enabling even beginners to formalize naive tasks like multivariate equations in minutes.

Making Litex intuitive to both humans and AI is Litex's core mission. We want people feel happy using Litex. Just like how Python lowers the barrier of programming by 10x compared with C/C++, Litex lowers the barrier of formal reasoning by 10x compared with previous formal languages like Lean. 

Since each Litex sentence corresponds directly to an expression in everyday mathematical language, and since it is supported by set theory (ZFC) and basic logic (not, forall, exist, or), Litex does not sacrifice any rigor. So please do not think about Litex using the mindset of traditional formal languages. Instead, imagine yourself as a college student or even a high school student who has a basic understanding of set theory — regardless of whether you like Litex or are skeptical of it.

*In summary, Litex is a piece of software that imitates the way people think when they verify mathematics in everyday reasoning, using a small number of straightforward rules.* 

## Litex For AI, For Math, For Everyone

_It’s best to do one thing really, really well._

Litex is a focused and deeply crafted language. We have invested significant effort in refining and enhancing it. Like other focused and profound products, users naturally find ways to integrate Litex into their own work—this is both inspiring and exciting. Here are some examples of how Litex is used:

Litex For AI

AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton notes that in mathematics, models operate like in Go or chess—within closed systems with fixed rules, where they can generate their own training data. Formal languages (e.g., Litex) are key to self-improvement because computers can automatically and reliably verify whether mathematical reasoning is correct, enabling effective self-supervised learning. 

This is crucial for the following areas:

Litex For Math

Litex enables automatic verification and large-scale mathematical collaboration. It clarifies dependency structures among complex theorems and transforms mathematical work into **mathematical engineering**—as intuitive as writing Python code, while maintaining full rigor through ZFC axioms.

Litex For Everyone

Litex is accessible to everyone—from children to experts. With just 1-2 hours of learning, anyone with basic set theory knowledge can write verified proofs. Litex's natural-language-like syntax makes it 10x easier to learn than traditional formal languages, democratizing rigorous mathematical thinking.

Although Litex is a very pragmatic language which contains and only contains the proof methods, axioms, keywords, etc. that people need in their daily mathematical work—things that are often so taken for granted that people usually don't even notice them —- it is equally important to note that Litex indeed has gained great conceptual inspiration from the masters.
