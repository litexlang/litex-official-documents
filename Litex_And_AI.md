# Litex and AI

Why does this matter for AI? As AIs generate content at scale, we need verifiable reasoning—especially for scientific exploration and safe AI agents. Formal languages like Litex enable computers to verify reasoning strictly and quickly, bridging human creativity with AI capabilities, or allowing AIs to enhance reasoning capability by themselves, just like how AlphaZero enhances itself in Go. There are more and more AI researchers start to use formal language as a tool for their work, especially safe AI, AI scientific exploration etc, but they do not really understand their code because learning curve of traditional formal languages is too high. 

Litex will not only solve AI researchers' problem, but also make formal languages accessible to ANYONE.
