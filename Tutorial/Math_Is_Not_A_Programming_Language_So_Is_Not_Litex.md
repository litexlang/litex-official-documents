# Math is Not a Programming Language So Is Not Litex

_Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower._

_— Steve Jobs_

| Feature | Mathematics | Programming |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Variable** | No real “variable” — once an object is defined, its meaning is fixed | Variables can change values during execution |
| **Existential Quantification** | You have to prove the existence of an object before using it. | You can use and declare a variable directly. |
| **Function** | A symbol that builds new expressions from input symbols (no execution) | A block of executable code that performs computation or side effects |
| **Execution** | No execution — everything is symbolic manipulation or `match and substitution` | Involves actual computation steps and runtime behavior |
| **Control Flow** | Uses logical constructs like ∀ (for all) to reason about all cases | Uses constructs like `for`, `while`, `if` to control the flow of execution |
| **Iteration** | Infinite or large domains handled abstractly (e.g. by induction or logic) | Requires explicit loops and step-by-step computation |
| **Purpose** | To prove or verify truth symbolically | To perform tasks, process data, interact with systems |
